        "Symptoms": "Leaves show water-soaked streaks that turn yellow and dry out, often starting at the leaf tip. Scalding and wilting may occur under severe infections.",
        "Cure": "Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent spread. Apply copper-based bactericides early in the disease cycle for effective control.",
        "Prevention": "Ensure good drainage, avoid overhead irrigation, use certified disease-free seeds, and avoid overcrowding of plants."
    },
    "Corn___Common_Rust": {
        "Symptoms": "Formation of small, circular to oval, reddish-brown pustules mostly on upper leaf surfaces. Severe cases lead to leaf blight and reduced photosynthesis.",
        "Cure": "Grow rust-resistant corn hybrids. Apply fungicides such as strobilurins or triazoles when rust is first detected.",
        "Prevention": "Plant at recommended times, manage irrigation to reduce humidity, and maintain proper row spacing to improve air circulation."
    },
    "Corn___Gray_Leaf_Spot": {
        "Symptoms": "Development of elongated, rectangular, gray to tan lesions on the leaf surface, often bordered by dark margins. Severe infections cause premature leaf death.",
        "Cure": "Timely application of fungicides like Trifloxystrobin or Azoxystrobin can help control the spread.",
        "Prevention": "Use crop rotation, remove infected plant residues post-harvest, and choose tolerant corn varieties."
    },
    "Corn___Healthy": {

    },
    "Potato___Early_Blight": {
        "Symptoms": "Dark, circular lesions with concentric rings (target-like) typically on older leaves. Yellowing may occur around lesions.",

    "Potato___Late_Blight": {
        "Symptoms": "Irregular brown lesions with pale green halos on leaves. Under moist conditions, white mold may appear on undersides of leaves.",
        "Cure": "Apply systemic fungicides such as Chlorothalonil or Metalaxyl. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.",
        "Prevention": "Avoid wet foliage by using drip irrigation, ensure proper spacing, and use disease-resistant varieties."
    },
    "Red Rot": {
        "Symptoms": "Internal red discoloration in the stalk, foul odor, and external leaf drying. Stalk becomes hollow and collapses in advanced stages.",
        "Cure": "Uproot and burn affected canes. Apply fungicides recommended for sugarcane like Bavistin to reduce infection.",
        "Prevention": "Use disease-free setts, plant resistant varieties, and treat setts before planting using fungicide dips."
    },
    "Rice___Brown_Spot": {
        "Symptoms": "Brown, circular to oval spots with gray centers appear on leaves, grains, and seeds, causing seed discoloration and reduced quality.",
        "Cure": "Use fungicides like Tricyclazole or Propiconazole at the booting stage for effective control.",
        "Prevention": "Balance soil nutrients especially nitrogen and potassium, ensure seed treatment, and maintain proper plant spacing."
    },
    "Rice___Healthy": {
        "Symptoms": "Green upright leaves, firm stems, and even grain fill. No spots, discoloration, or stunted growth observed.",
        "Cure": "No cure required.",

    },
    "Rice___Leaf_Blast": {
        "Symptoms": "Spindle-shaped lesions with gray centers and brown margins appear on leaves. Severe cases cause leaf death and reduced tillering.",
        "Cure": "Spray systemic fungicides like Carbendazim or Tricyclazole when early symptoms are visible.",
        "Prevention": "Use blast-resistant varieties, avoid excessive nitrogen application, and ensure good water drainage."
    },
    "Rice___Neck_Blast": {
        "Symptoms": "Panicle neck turns brown to black and shrivels, leading to incomplete grain filling and severe yield loss.",
        "Cure": "Apply systemic fungicides during panicle initiation stage such as Iprobenphos or Tricyclazole.",
        "Prevention": "Adopt balanced fertilizer usage, plant blast-resistant varieties, and ensure proper field sanitation."
    },
    "Wheat___Brown_Rust": {
        "Symptoms": "Rusty brown pustules develop in clusters primarily on leaf surfaces. In severe cases, leaves may dry out completely.",
        "Cure": "Timely foliar application of fungicides such as Propiconazole helps control the infection.",
        "Prevention": "Use resistant varieties, sow early to escape disease-prone periods, and maintain field sanitation."
